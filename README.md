# Konigs

[Live demo](https://sandicat.github.io/Konigs/)

A mind map creator with dynamic layouting. Simply add concepts (nodes) and connect them (edges). A layouting algorithm will interactively arrange them for you. The core idea is that the user should only worry about describing the world and the app should figure out how to display it nicely. Completely client side, works offline, stores documents in local storage.

Written in Elm. Uses elm-css and elm-mdl. Builds with webpack. I might upgrade it to elm-ui one day.
